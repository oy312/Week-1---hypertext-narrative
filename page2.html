      this playlist is called TekmiXuS. The first video is a hard tekno live set
      with these cool live visuals. Hypnotic sometimes theres figures of people
      in it. i always wonder what they are up to right now?
    </p>

    <p>
      the channel that this video is posted from has 157k subscribers called
      p4kid3rm for underground tekno located in italy... which has a huge free
      tekno scene. this whole set was live using only pure analog drum machines.
      that is so goals.

    <p>ok nearly an hour has passed... time to go to...</p>
