      found this on the channel. posted two days ago as of 9.24.23. its clips
      from a free tek rave somewhere in italy. im so happy that people archive
      little moments like this. just shitty quality video from a good time
      someone else had across the world. you might think no one would want to
      watch it but you never know who could be inspired. archiving is cool.
      sharing is cool.

      here i am sitting on my laptop on a rainy ny day watching this clip. and
      here you are wherever you are watching this same clip. maybe you wouldnt
      have come across it if it wasn't for me? or maybe you would? but now you
      did :-) and now i did too.
